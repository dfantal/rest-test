BackEnd Take Home Assignment Question
Build a set of REST APIs for doing CRUD operations to create, update and
delete a Collection.  Using Spring boot is recommended, but not required.
 
A Collection is a way to group things. This can be anything – Products, Content,
etc., A collection can be created for a particular country. E.g: A collection of
products for France. The collection has attributes like name, the list of things, the
country it is for etc., The collection has to be localized for different languages.
Some countries like the US has only English. But a country like Canada will have
